<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Brackets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Ligating</li><li>Conventional</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ceramic brackets market can be divided into two main types: self-ligating and conventional brackets. Self-ligating brackets feature a built-in mechanism that holds the archwire in place, reducing friction and allowing for faster tooth movement and easier adjustments. Conventional brackets, on the other hand, require elastic or metal ligatures to secure the archwire, resulting in more friction and longer treatment times. Both types offer aesthetic advantages over traditional metal brackets, appealing to patients seeking discreet orthodontic options.</p></p>
